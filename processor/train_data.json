    "9399468": "Disclosed is a feature for a vehicle that enables taking precautionary actions in response to conditions on the road network around or ahead of the vehicle, in particular, an intersection located at the bottom of a hill. A database that represents the road network is used to determine locations where an intersection of roads is located at the bottom of a hill and then, precautionary action data is added to the database to indicate such locations. A precautionary action system installed in a vehicle uses this database, or a database derived therefrom, in combination with a positioning system to take a precautionary action as the vehicle approaches such a location. The present invention relates to a method and system that enables taking a precautionary action in a vehicle, such as providing a warning to a vehicle driver about a potentially difficult or hazardous driving condition on the road network. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including active safety and fuel economy systems, have been developed to improve the comfort, efficiency, safety, and overall satisfaction of driving. Examples of these advanced driver assistance systems include adaptive headlight aiming, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and control, curve warning, speed limit notification, hazard warning, predictive cruise control, and adaptive shift control, as well as others. Some of these advanced driver assistance systems use a variety of sensor mechanisms in the vehicle to determine the current state of the vehicle and the current state of the roadway in front of the vehicle. These sensor mechanisms may include radar, infrared, ultrasonic and vision-oriented sensors, such as digital video cameras and lidar. Some advanced driver assistance systems also use digital map data. Digital map data can be used in advanced driver assistance systems to provide information about the road network, road geometry, road conditions and other items associated with the road and terrain around the vehicle. Digital map data is not affected by environmental conditions, such as fog, rain or snow. In addition, digital map data can provide useful information that cannot reliably be provided by cameras or radar, such as curvature, grade, bank, speed limits that are not indicated by signage, traffic and lane restrictions, etc. Further, digital map data can provide a predictive capability well beyond the range of other sensors or even beyond the driver's vision to determine the road ahead of the vehicle, around corners, over hills or beyond obstructions. Accordingly, digital map data can be a useful addition for some advanced driver assistance systems. Although these kinds of systems provide useful features, there exists room for further improvements. For example, it would be useful to identify locations on the road network where a relatively high number of traffic accidents have occurred. However, statistics pertaining to accidents are maintained by various different administrative entities that use different formats, standards, reporting methods, reporting periods, etc. Accordingly, it is difficult to obtain consistent information about traffic accidents on roads in a large geographic region, such as the entire United States or Europe. Moreover, data indicating locations where a statistically large number of traffic accidents occur may not indicate the causes of the accidents or how accidents can be avoided.",

The events are separate from activities represented by the data records. Providing the event visual indicators transparently overlaid over the cells in the at least some blocks depict a relationship and relative impact between the data records and the events. Understanding relatively large amounts of data can pose a challenge to the enterprise. It is undesirable to have to manually review the relatively large amounts of data on a data record by data record basis. For example, if the collected/maintained data includes customer surveys, it would be undesirable to have to manually review the surveys individually to understand the content of such surveys, as having to review a large number of surveys is time consuming and can involve relatively large amounts of personnel, which can be expensive. Moreover, certain characteristics of data collected or maintained by the enterprise may be caused by external events. An external event refers to any event that is separate from the activities represented by data collected or maintained by the enterprise. For example, if the collected/maintained data includes customer surveys, then examples of external events that can affect characteristics of the customer surveys (e.g., customer scores satisfaction or other characteristics) include a promotional sale of offerings by the enterprise, failure or fault of a system (e.g., a website crashing), and so forth.

In particular, considerable sums are expended to design and manufacture roller cone rock bits and fixed cutter bits in a manner that minimizes the opportunity for catastrophic drill bit failure during drilling operations. The loss of a roller cone or a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutter from a fixed cutter bit during drilling operations can impede the drilling operations and, at worst, necessitate rather expensive fishing operations. If the fishing operations fail, sidetrack-drilling operations must be performed in order to drill around the portion of the wellbore that includes the lost roller cones or PDC cutters. Thus, during drilling operations, bits are pulled and replaced with new bits out of an abundance of caution, even though significant service could still be obtained from the replaced bit. These premature replacements of downhole drill bits are expensive, since each trip out of the well prolongs the overall drilling activity, and consumes considerable manpower, but are nevertheless done in order to avoid the far more disruptive and expensive process of, at best, pulling the drill string and replacing the bit or fishing and sidetrack drilling operations necessary if one or more cones or PDC cutters are lost due to bit failure.",

    "9165116": "The present invention provides a data mining framework for mining high-quality structured clinical information. The data mining framework includes a data miner that mines medical information from a computerized patient record (CPR) based on domain-specific knowledge contained in a knowledge base. The data miner includes components for extracting information from the CPR, combining all available evidence in a principled fashion over time, and drawing inferences from this combination process. The mined medical information is stored in a structured CPR which can be a data warehouse. Health care providers accumulate vast stores of clinical information. However, efforts to mine clinical information have not proven to be successful. In general, data mining is a process to determine useful patterns or relationships in data stored in a data repository. Typically, data mining involves analyzing very large quantities of information to discover trends hidden in the data. Clinical information maintained by health care organizations is usually unstructured. Therefore, it is difficult to mine using conventional methods. Moreover, since clinical information is collected to treat patients, as opposed, for example, for use in clinical trials, it may contain missing, incorrect, and inconsistent data. Often key outcomes and variables are simply not recorded. While many health care providers maintain billing information in a relatively structured format, this type of information is limited by insurance company requirements. That is, billing information generally only captures information needed to process medical claims, and more importantly reflects the billing view of the patient, i.e., coding the bill for maximum reimbursement. As a result, billing information often contains inaccurate and missing data, from a clinical point of view. Furthermore, studies show that billing codes are incorrect in a surprisingly high fraction of patients (often 10% to 20%). Given that mining clinical information could lead to insights that otherwise would be difficult or impossible to obtain, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to provide techniques for mining structured high-quality clinical information.",
    "4323119": "Shale or the like having hydrocarbon deposits therein is exposed to a liquid carrier medium such as water or distillate. High level vibratory energy is applied to the hydrocarbon carrying shale and the liquid to cause the oil shale to comminute so as to release the hydrocarbon therefrom, the hydrocarbon itself being comminuted and suspended in the carrier liquid, which liquid is then removed and the oil separated therefrom. This invention relates to the mining of shale oil and similar hydrocarbons, and more particularly to apparatus for such mining involving the use of a carrier liquid in conjunction with sonic energy wherein the sonic energy comminutes the kerogen which is suspended in the liquid for subsequent separation therefrom. Shale oil is generally found in the form of a hydrocarbon called kerogen which is a wax-like hydrocarbon packed between multiple layers of shale. While oil shale has been a known source of oil for many years, no efficient means has been found to date for the extraction of the oil from the kerogen deposits within the shale. Mining the shale by conventional procedures, followed by above ground processing involving retorting (heating) of the kerogen, has been used to a limited degree for a number of years. However, in view of the relatively small yield of oil from each ton of shale mined and processed, this approach has been regarded as of questionable economical feasibility. Further, this approach presents the problem of disposing of large quantities of spent shale. In order to overcome these difficulties, in situ processing of oil shale has been tried experimentally in recent years. Such in situ processes of the prior art are implemented by the sinking of a shaft into the oil shale formation and then forcing hot combustion gases through the oil shale to convert the solid organic kerogen contained therein to oil which is then drawn to the surface.",

In another embodiment, a computer readable storage medium, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer for routing at least one interest packet in a named data network including a plurality of nodes is provided, the program of instructions, when executing, performing the following steps: mapping each of a plurality of names of a respective plurality of data objects to one of a plurality of path labels, wherein each path label uniquely identifies a path between a source node and a destination node; and providing an interest packet having both the name of a requested data object and one of the path labels, wherein the path label provided with the interest packet points to the requested data object at the destination node of the path label provided with the interest packet. Referring now to FIG. 2B, an example data exchange between a consumer (e.g., consumer 203A of FIG. 2A) and a producer (e.g., producer 205A of FIG. 2A) proceeds as follow. First, (see Step 251) an application at the consumer 203A creates an interest packet stating the name of the data object that there is interest to retrieve. Given the data object name (see Step 253), the consumer 203A (or alternatively a first hop broker node, e.g., broker 207A) fills in the interest packet with an appropriate path label. The label is selected (see Step 255) from a set of path labels provided by the controller node 209 (or alternatively retrieved locally, e.g., from the cache of broker 207A. Then (see Step 257), the interest packet is forward from broker 207A to another node (e.g., broker 207F) based on the selected path label. Any broker node that has the data object locally cached can reply with the data object, without needing to forward the interest to the producer node (in this example, producer 205A). Finally (see Step 259), the data object response packet reaches the consumer node (in this example, consumer 203A) using the reverse path label (that is, a path label the reverse of the originally selected path label). Of note, the controller(s) may communicate bi-directionally with any one or more of the consumers, brokers and/or producers.",
    "9160606": "A remote access system for processing local data with a computing algorithm stores information on various computing algorithms available via the system. A remote user at a user system selects an algorithm, which is then encrypted and downloaded to the user system. The downloaded algorithm is decrypted and stored in host memory in a controlled manner. Alternatively, the selected algorithm may be offered through cloud processing, in which case the user uploads local data for cloud processing. In this case, the system manages the cloud processing at remote providers and tracks heuristic, caching, and performance. In either case, the local data is processed with input parameters from the user, and visual results are provided to the user along with a cost for storing final results of the processing. Once the user makes the required payment, the final results can be stored locally at the user system.Many industries use scientific algorithms to process data for various purposes. For example, seismic data processing services use various types of algorithms to process complex sets of data to provide seismic imaging and other services for clients. As will be appreciated, there are a host of algorithms for processing data, such as seismic data. Some algorithms require more or less resources, and some algorithms may actually be proprietary. The computing infrastructure required to process complex sets of data with scientific algorithms is not always available to the typical user. Instead, users must use an outside data processing service to process the user's data and provide results. Although current circumstances may be acceptable in some instances, users may never be able to use (or even just try out) certain algorithms for themselves without making extensive arrangements with outside parties who provide the algorithms and computing services. In the schematic diagram of FIG. 1, a remote access computing system 10 according to the present disclosure allows remote users to access any of a number of scientific computing algorithms and use a selected algorithm to process the user's local data. The system 10 provides scientific computing to remote client users, who can parameterize and visualize results of the scientific computing algorithm on local data before paying for the service. The client user can parameterize and perturb the variables and operation of the algorithm to see how the algorithm functions with the client's data. Ultimately, the client user needs to actually pay for the use of the processing and the algorithm before obtaining full results of the computation. Thus, the client user when satisfied with the visual results provided can then pay through the system 10 to save or apply their results. In general, the system 10 includes one or more system servers 30 and associated computing hardware. For ease of description, the one or more system servers 30 and components are simply referred to herein as a system server, although it will be appreciated that the system 10 can use a number of severs and components known and used in the art. The system server 30 stores information on various scientific computing algorithms 40, heuristic and historical information in a heuristic database 42, and caching details in a caching database 44. The system server 30 uses various processes or mechanisms, including an encryption mechanism 50 for encrypting the algorithms 40, a heuristic mechanism 250 for populating the heuristic database 42, and a caching mechanism 260 for populating the caching database 44. Finally, the system server 30 has various interfaces 60 to provide client users with remote access to scientific computing algorithms and computing services. Instead, in one embodiment, the system server 30 uses the encryption mechanism 50 to encrypt discrete processing components of the algorithm 40 and can use a number of security schemes to restrict access to the algorithm 40. In particular, a pre-installed client application 24 running on the user's device 20 handles download of the encrypted algorithm 40 and uses a current web or communication session and tracking in a web-based link to the system server 30 to control access to (and use of) the downloaded algorithm 40. The client application 24 can then decrypt the algorithm 40 at time of use in the host memory (i.e., RAM 28) only so that the algorithm 40 is never stored on the client's hard drive 26 or other memory location. In fact, for the purposes of encryption and security, the client application 24 can map the downloaded algorithm in the host memory under the current web session between the client system 20 and the system server 30. This mapping can keep other processes from reading from that mapped memory to access details of the algorithm 40. As will be appreciated, these and other security measures can be used to limit local access to the encrypted algorithm 40 and the processing performed on the client system 20.",

    "4878712": "Coal is mined using water jets to a remove a layer of thin horizontal slices of coal. The thickness of the layer is sufficiently small that elastic deformation of the roof of the layer due to settling will cause the roof to rest against the floor of the layer. A number of additional layers of slices are then extracted in the same manner, each immediately below the floor of the preceding layer. The thickness and location of these layers wiht respect to previous layers is such that elastic deformation of the roof of the first layer due to settling will cause the roof to rest against the floor of the last layer of slices. Through the sequential mining of layers in this manner from top to bottom, the entire seam of coal is extracted and the mine roof rests upon the mine floor without the need for artificial roof support. This invention provides a method of mining coal using water jets to a remove a series of thin horizontal slices of coal in a substantially horizontal plane. The upper and lower surfaces of these slices form a substantially continuous roof and floor, respectively, above and below the slices. The thickness of the slices is sufficiently small that elastic downward deformation of the roof caused by settling will result in a portion of the roof resting against a portion of the floor. This allows the integrity of the mine roof to be maintained. A number of additional layers are then extracted, each layer consisting of a number of thin horizontal slices of coal in a substantially horizontal plane immediately below the floor of the preceding layer of slices. Once again, the thickness of these slices and the location of these slices with respect to previous layers is such that elastic deformation of the roof of the first layer caused by settling will result in a portion of the roof being supported by a portion of the floor of the last layer of slices. Through the sequential mining of layers in this manner from top to bottom, the entire seam of coal is extracted and the mine roof rests upon the mine floor without the need for artificial roof support. This provides substantial advantages in terms of economic savings to the mine operator. Furthermore, due to the fact that miners do not need to enter the areas of the coal seam being excavated, the present method provides improved safety conditions for the miners. Another advantage of the present invention is the fact that any subsidence of the surface of the earth caused by mining coal in accordance with the present method will occur within a relatively short period of time following excavation of the coal deposit. In contrast, conventional coal mines can continue to cause unpredictable surface subsidence for decades following abandonment of the mine as artificial roof supports gradually fail.",

A conventional drill bit is modified by removing material from the forward portion of the bit to increase the radius of the cutting edge. The drill bit is then coated with a nanostructured diamond film using a chemical vapor deposition process.A drill bit is a cutting tool for drilling a hole in a work piece made of a variety of materials, such as wood, metal, plastic, and alloys. In general, it is difficult to drill multiple holes in hard material, such as a high-strength alloy, particularly when the cutting edges of the drill bit become ineffective as the drill bit is dulled by repeated use caused by the abrasive properties of the hard material. Diamond coatings applied to the cutting edges of a drill bit have overcome some of the problems associated with drilling hard materials. However, diamond coatings on the drill bit often separates from the drill bit material (serving as substrate for the coating) after intensive and continuous use. A useful, although comparatively expensive, coating is a polycrystalline diamond (PCD) coating that is applied by brazing. To reduce cost other methods of applying diamond containing coatings are often used. However, some of the other methods of applying diamond coatings have problems with coating/substrate separation.",

A secondary shaft is fixed to the pedal and is configured to position the pedal, which has been sheared off, in a new operating position.However, with this type of device for mounting, there is the not inconsiderable risk of the shearing device being triggered inadvertently for no apparent reason, whilst the vehicle is in a normal driving phase and without being subjected to any specific impact. The pedal would then become detached from its support without the driver being able to benefit from the usual function of said pedal, such as a braking or clutch function, for example. Even if the probability of seeing such a phenomenon occurring remains minimal, the consequences thereof could prove very serious in terms of injury to the body and/or damage to equipment.

In one particularly advantageous embodiment the second FEC code may be a single parity check (SPC) and the scheme may be referred to as a SPC-BICM-ID scheme. In such an embodiment, the incoming data stream may be demultiplexed into a plurality of data streams with each of the data streams being coded with a low density parity check (LDPC) FEC code and then bit-interleaved.

An address point data mining method, system, or program product can determine geographic coordinates of an address based on geographic locations of one or more user devices. Each user device can be a mobile device operable to determine a location using a global navigation system (e.g., GPS), wireless signal triangulation, or other techniques. During the course of a time period (e.g., a day or week), the user device can stay at a location for a significant amount of time. The system can crosscheck this location with a geocoded geographic coordinates of a registered address (e.g., a billing address) that is associated with the mobile device. The system can determine whether the geocoded geographic coordinates are accurate based on result of the crosscheck. An online map service can provide virtual maps to one or more user devices. The virtual maps can include land features (e.g., houses, office buildings, or shops). The land features can be positioned along a street in a virtual map based on their locations.

The vLUN provides a plurality of logical chunk addresses (LCAs) and the mapped LUN provides a plurality of physical chunk addresses (PCAs), where each LCA or PCA stores a respective chunk of data. The mapping layer defines a layout of the mapped LUN that facilitates efficient read and write access to the mapped LUN.Enterprises as well as individuals are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. As more and more data are generated, the need for efficient and reliable data storage systems, as well as for increased amounts of available storage, is increasing. There are a variety of systems in existence today, utilizing both local and network storage for processes such as primary and backup data storage. For example, during a backup operation, the data from the data sources are copied to the backup devices. Commonly, there is a substantial amount of data from each of the data sources that remains the same between two consecutive backups, and sometimes there are several copies of the same data. Similarly, in primary storage systems, different applications, or users of the same application, might be storing the same file, such as an email message or an operating system related file. These and other types of systems can have more available space and be more efficient if unchanged data, or data for which a duplicate already exists, is not written, or rewritten, to the storage device. Various approaches have been used to reduce the amount of information that is stored (referred to herein as), including techniques such as data compression, file deduplication, block deduplication, and delta block optimization (also referred to as delta-based deduplication). Data compression techniques are essentially transparent to applications and storage hardware and use well-known algorithms to reduce the size of files by eliminating redundant bits. Compression is capable of providing, depending on data type, significant reductions in data, as is well understood in the art. There can still be multiple copies of a given file, however, even if all of the copies are compressed, because compression cannot detect or reduce multiple copies of the same file. Delta block optimization reduces the amount of data backed up and stored from a source by attempting to determine which blocks are new and then writing only the blocks that are changed to backup. This technique does not, however, reduce multiple copies of the same file that can be written to storage by different users. File-level deduplication removes multiple copies of the same file, where duplicate files are replaced with a pointer to the unique version of the file. Typically, file-level duplication is not effective at removing files that have minor changes compared with previous versions of the file.

In a further embodiment, the system further comprises a data reduction engine in operable communication with the mapping layer, the data reduction engine configured to: perform a data reduction process on a first chunk of data stored in a first LCA on the vLUN so as to determine that the first chunk of data stored at the first LCA is a first unneeded chunk; remap the first LCA of the first unneeded chunk from the first PCA in the first region to a second PCA in the second region of the mapped LUN, where the remapping of the first LCA results in the physical storage associated with the first PCA no longer being required to be used to store data associated with the first LCA; and provide information to the first portion of the metadata region indicating that the corresponding PCA for the first unneeded chunk has changed from the first PCA in the first region to the second PCA in the second region. The data reduction engine is further operable to, in one embodiment, to deallocate the first PCA associated with the first unneeded chunk, the deallocation freeing the first PCA and its associated physical storage chunk for re-use by another LCA in the vLUN. In a further embodiment, the system further comprises an input/output (I/O) filter driver in operable communication with the mapped LUN, the mapping layer, and the vLUN, the I/O filter driver operable to map read and writes to LCAs in the vLUN to the corresponding first or second region in the mapped LUN.",
    "8838510": "A system, method and program product for selecting an algorithm and feature set to solve a problem. A perpetual analytics system is disclosed that provides a genetic algorithm for jointly selecting an algorithm and feature set to solve a problem, comprising: an evolutionary computing engine for processing data encoded as chromosomes, wherein each chromosome encodes an algorithm and a feature set; a domain knowledge store that maintains a plurality of algorithms and a plurality of features; a system for applying a generation of chromosomes to a set of data to provide a set of results; and a fitness function for evaluating the set of results to rate a performance of each chromosome in the set of chromosomes; wherein the evolutionary computing engine is adapted to evolve a subset of the set of chromosomes into a new generation of chromosomes.The accelerating data avalanche is gaining unimpeded momentum that is enabled by the commoditization of computing storage, devices, bandwidth, connectivity, processor parallelization, and processor speed. Consequently, numerous data mining algorithms are becoming available to sift through massive amounts of information. Businesses and governments that do not embrace advanced data analytics will not survive within an environment of highly connected and intelligent enterprise. Along with the advancement of data mining tools, applying the right algorithm to a problem is critical. For example, practitioners might choose a familiar algorithm for a specific problem that produces a suboptimal solution while a highly tuned system continually determines the best algorithm to apply towards a problem. Equally important, the diversity and dimensionality of data is becoming more challenging and is already intractable. Dimensionality reduction and variable selection is required to select the most important traits of data from an exhaustive set of features. However, varying algorithms will perform differently given changing feature sets. Accurately selecting an algorithm and a set of features is critical to achieve optimal performance. Currently, purely academic, complex and novel algorithms are distilling information into knowledge to solve difficult and real business challenges. However, with the growing number of regressors, classifiers and density estimators, determining which algorithm to implement on a particular problem domain currently requires extensive domain expertise. For example, illustrative algorithms include techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Bayesian Belief Networks, numerous clustering algorithms, Hidden Markov Models, Case Based Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, Regression, Mixture Models, Kernels, etc. The field of statistics produces similarly diverse methods such as Principal Component Analysis, Probability Density Functions, Discrete and Continuous distributions, hypothesis testing, etc. The present invention addresses the process of selecting an analytic algorithm or model and the features of the data of which to process. A framework of feature and algorithm selection is herein described for perpetual knowledge generation. The selection of features and algorithms to apply for a specific problem must be robust such that they can be encoded into a search and optimization problem. High dimensional searching requires careful consideration to explore the least amount of space while finding a best solution or a Pareto optimal hull. Evolutionary algorithms, modeled from nature, provide a parameterized framework for such searching. Nature provides natural systems that evolve over time within the context of an ecology. Within natural selection, the fittest members or groups of species pass their respective genes to the next generation. As such, the entire species adapts and changes as ecologies change. The best fit members defined as a combination of data features and algorithms are suited for a given environment or problem. Genetic algorithms are inspired by biology and provide robust search and optimization techniques. Genetic algorithms utilize a fitness function to measure the utility of a chromosome. Generally, a fitness function is either applied directly to a chromosome or the phenotype of the translated representation. A chromosome is a concise and natural data representation of a set of parameters. The entire set of chromosomes creates a generation. The genetic operators within the framework of the algorithm can be either binary or probabilistic. Reproduction crossover and mutation are the three core functions that generally exist within a genetic algorithm. FIG. 1 depicts a perpetual analytic system 10 for selecting an algorithm 14 and set of features 16 based on an inputted problem 12. (It is understood that for the purposes of this disclosure, the term algorithm includes any approach for solving a problem, e.g., models,neural networks, artificial intelligence, etc.) Perpetual analytic system 10 generally includes a genetic algorithm 32 that encompasses: a domain knowledge store 18 the includes of a set of algorithms 20 and a set of features 22; one or more fitness functions 24 for determining how well a selected algorithm/feature performs; a genetic algorithm (GA) parameter determination system 26 that determines how the genetic algorithm 32 is to be implemented; and an evolutionary computer engine 34 for processing chromosomes that encode algorithm/feature sets. Also included is a training system 28 for off line and on line training and a database 30 of data relevant to the particular problem 12.",

    "7089160": "A method of creating a mathematical model which is employed in the determination of at least one work location in a multi-layered laminated circuit panel. The mathematical model for modifying drill data takes into consideration translational and rotational compensations caused by the encountered stretching or shrinking of the multi-layered panel subsequent to pressing or due to thermally processing, whereby the mathematical model may be utilized to modify drill data in order to accurately predict hole or via locations.The present invention relates to a method of creating a mathematical model which is employed in the determination of at least one work location in a multi-layered laminated circuit panel. More particularly, the invention is directed to the creation of a mathematical model for modifying drill data which takes into consideration translational and rotational compensations caused by the encountered stretching or shrinking of the multi-layered panel subsequent to pressing or due to thermally processing, whereby the mathematical model may be utilized to modify drill data in order to accurately predict hole or via locations. In the implementation of pressing and/or thermal processes employed in producing multi-layered panels for semiconductor packages, such panels frequently will stretch or shrink in non-uniformly translational and rotational aspects, and consequently may be the source of erroneous locations in the formation of holes or vias which are drilled into the panels, thereby rendering the panels unsuitable for installation in electronic packages, and subjecting the processes to economic losses for the manufactures. At times, such positional errors in the formation of fiducial holes or vias and slots by means of laser drilling are encountered when utilizing the same machine, such as a drilling apparatus, with the same drilling location set up. Currently, the only translational compensation which is incorporated into the drilling data for drill machines employed in forming holes or vias in panels, such as those for electronic packages or printed circuits, fail to provide any integrated vision systems. This renders any corrections for distortions encountered in the multi-layered panels to be difficult to attain so as to be able to compensate precisely for distortional stretching or shrinkage conditions which are encountered during the pressing or thermal processing of the panels prior to effectuating their drilling. In essence, none of the prior art patent publications are adapted to provide a method of creating a mathematical model for modifying drill data employed in the drilling of holes or vias in a multi-layered panel or printed circuit board, which takes into account both translational and rotational compensations in x and y directional planes due to the stretching or shrinking of the panels encountered due to pressing or thermal processing of the panels. Although the present invention is directed to the translation and scaling in both x and y directions, the rotational compensations generally are directed to meeting the change in the angle formed between two parallel lines subsequent to the pressing or thermal processing of the panels. In particular, the inventive concept is essentially contemplated in applying the measurement of some features of a panel, generally, preferable for each panel prior to lamination; implementing lamination of the multi-layered panels; measuring these features subsequent to lamination; utilizing an algorithm to calculate the rotation and scale of coordinate offsets which are encountered in the x and y directions; modifying the data file; and finally drilling the panel based on the modified data file of the information conveyed to a drilling apparatus or machine. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to derive a method for determining at least one work location in a multi-layered laminated circuit panel by providing a first circuitized core element having fiduciary marks, providing at least one additional metallic element, providing a data file having reference coordinates of the multi-layered circuit panel work locations and also having the reference coordinates of the fidicuary mark locations of the first circuitized core element with the reference coordinates of the fiduciary marks of the first circuitized core element, creating a modified work location by adjusting the data file with the rotational and scale coordinate offset of the fiduciary mark locations, and modifying the multi-layered circuit panel at the modified work location.",

    "4453594": "A electrolytic method and its associated apparatus for in situ recovery of coal products. With this method, the recoverable coal is in physical contact with a series of two or more positive electrodes while it is isolated from a single negative electrode by an electrolytic solution. The negative electrode and positive electrode are in boreholes which are drilled and are configured in the earth such that the positive electrodes may surround the single negative electrode. An electrolyte is placed in the center borehole with the negative electrode inserted in the liquid but insulated and positioned so as not to touch the coal in the side of the borehole. All of the positive electrodes in the adjacent boreholes are serially electrically connected to each other and to the positive terminal of an electrical potential difference source. The negative electrode is connected to the negative terminal of the same power source to initiate an electrolytic reaction in the coal-bearing earth. Coal products formed by this reaction may be periodically or continuously recovered and the extracted electrolyte replaced by a fresh electrolyte. A method and its associated apparatus for recovering in situ coal from the earth utilizing electrolysis. A first borehole is drilled from the surface to the recoverable coal seam. Next, an electrolyte is introduced into the borehole. Following this, a metal (negative) electrode is mounted in the center of the borehole. This electrode is coaxial with an electrically insulated sheath and fixed in the tube so that the outside metal surface is separated from the inside of the sheath. Additional boreholes transecting the coal seam may be provided around the negative or central borehole. An expanding electrode is inserted into each of these surrounding boreholes until it is adjacent the coal seam. Once these electrodes are in place, their respective expansion devices are actuated to firmly cause them to physically engage the coal seam. On the surface, electrical contact is made with all of the electrodes in the additional boreholes, and all are connected to a common point. This point will be connected to the positive terminal of a direct current power supply, and, therefore, the whole coal seam surrounding and intersecting the central hole will be a giant positive electrode. A potential difference between the negative electrode and the common positive electrodes causes an electrolysis reaction to take place in the central hole. After electrolysis has proceeded to a point where it is carrying a significant amount of acid products, it is pumped to the surface and replaced by fresh electrolyte. The extracted coal (carboxylic acid) can then be processed as desired. Also, throughout the electrolysis, hydrogen gas, formed at the negative electrode and guided to the surface by its sheath, is pumped off and stored. Likewise, oxygen formed at the coal surface flows up to the head of the central borehole and is pumped off and stored.",

The drill-pipe communication assembly includes a first drill pipe and an insulated tube disposed within, and generally concentric with, the first drill pipe. A male insert is disposed within a first end of the first drill pipe and a female insert is disposed within a second end of the first drill pipe. A conductor is electrically coupled to the male insert and the female insert. The conductor extends along a length of the first drill pipe. The conductor facilitates transmission of electrical signals from the first end of the first drill pipe to the second end of the first drill pipe.The practice of drilling non-vertical wells through directional drilling (sometimes referred to as slant drilling) has become very common in energy and mining industries. Directional drilling exposes a larger section of subterranean reservoirs than vertical drilling, and allows multiple subterranean locations to be reached from a single drilling location thereby reducing costs associated with operating multiple drilling rigs. In addition, directional drilling often allows access to subterranean formations where vertical access is difficult or impossible such as, for example, formations located under a populated area or formations located under a body of water or other natural impediment. Despite the many advantages of directional drilling, the high cost associated with completing a well is often cited as the largest shortcoming of directional drilling. This is due to the fact that directional drilling is often much slower than vertical drilling due to requisite data-acquisition steps. Data acquisition requires an electrical connection to be present between a down-hole tool and surface equipment. Embedding an electrical conductor into a drill rod expedites data acquisition associated with directional drilling and reduces overall costs associated with directional drilling. The present application relates generally to drilling and mining operations and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a drill pipe having an insulated conductor embedded therein for transmission of data.

The second processor is configured to generate a second estimate of the data based on the first estimate of the data, the estimate of the noise, and a second Viterbi algorithm. The output signal includes the second estimate of the data.The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure. Perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) is a desired technology for hard disk drive storage due to its associated high storage densities. PMR refers to the vertical alignment of data bits on a recording medium, such as a disk. This vertical alignment provides additional space on the storage medium, thereby enabling higher recording densities. To decode the stored data on the storage medium, a trellis-based Viterbi detector is often coupled to an associated read channel and has certain performance limitations.Referring to FIG. 1, a traditional read channel detection architecture 10 is shown. The architecture 10 includes a finite impulse response (FIR) filter 12 that receives data samples r(t) and generates an equalized data signal 14. The equalized signal 14 is received by a nonlinear Viterbi (NLV) detector 16 that has an internal Viterbi algorithm to determine the most likely sequence of hidden states. The Viterbi detector 16 produces a preliminary non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data estimates 18 and final NRZ data estimates 20. The final NRZ estimates are produced after a certain amount of latency. This latency is referred to as the Viterbi path memory length. The path memory length is set sufficiently long such that the surviving paths of the Viterbi algorithm merge with high probability and the final NRZ data estimates have good reliability. A surviving path is the most likely path to a particular hidden state. The preliminary NRZ data estimates 18 have a smaller Viterbi path memory depth than the final NRZ data estimates 20 and thus are referred to as Viterbi early decisions. The early decisions are used to reconstruct the output of the FIR 12 by convolving with a partial response target or reconstruction filter 22. The preliminary NRZ data estimates 18 are received by the reconstruction filter 22 to generate reconstructed FIR outputs 24. A delay block 26 is connected between the output 28 of the FIR 12 and the reconstruction filter 22. Reconstructed FIR outputs 24 are subtracted from the delayed FIR outputs 30 of the delay block 26 to generate an error signal 32. The error signal 32 is used to calculate error gradients for timing loop, automatic again control (AGC) loop, baseline correction loop, and FIR adaptation loop purposes. A system is provided and includes a storage medium, a demodulator, and a decoder. The demodulator is configured to (i) receive an input signal from the storage medium, and (ii) demodulate the input signal. The decoder is configured to estimate data stored in the storage medium by decoding the demodulated input signal to provide an output signal.

The body portion can be separated along the first direction into a distal cutting segment, and a guiding segment. The body portion can include a helical flute that winds about the central axis. The helical flute can define a first outer profile along the cutting segment and a second outer profile along the guiding segment, the first outer profile has a first leading edge and a first bearing surface and the second outer profile has a second leading edge and a second bearing surface. The first leading edge can be configured to cut into bone and can be spaced from the central axis by a first length. The second leading edge can be spaced from the central axis by a second length that is less than the first length. Certain medical procedures, such as osteosynthesis, are performed to stabilize and join bone segments to each other. Such procedures use stabilizing members such as rods or metal plates that are coupled to the bone segments by fixation elements such as bone screws, tacks, rivets, etc. Prior to the insertion of the bone screws into the bone segments, holes are pre-drilled into the bone segments using a surgical drill. Various surgical drills are currently in use that facilitate the user to drill at many speeds from several rpms up to and possible exceeding 90,000 rpms. Because of the varying speeds, the drill can behave like a milling tool and cuts into the wall of the hole thereby unintentionally and undesirably widening the diameter of the hole. This cutting effect can be compounded by chatter, vibration, axial torsion by the user, and bone quality, each of which can cause the drill to counter rotate (i.e. wobble) about a center axis of the hole. In some cases, the hole diameter increases up to 30% of the desired hole diameter. Moreover, because of the high speed in which such drills operate, heat can build up thereby causing thermal damage in the bone segments. Therefore, current drill bits not only have problems with creating repeatable hole sizes but also harm the surrounding bone while the holes are being formed. For at least these reasons, the bone screws used during osteosynthesis fixation are at risk to a degraded performance due to the unintentional loss of bone caused by standard drill bits. In an embodiment, a surgical drill bit can be configured to form a hole in an anatomical structure. The surgical drill bit can include an elongate cylindrical body portion that defines a proximal end, a distal end spaced from the proximal end along a first direction, and a central axis that extends along the first direction. The body portion can be separated along the first direction into a distal cutting segment, and a guiding segment that is proximal to the cutting segment. The body portion can include at least one helical flute that winds about the central axis from the distal end to the proximal end.

The second outer profile can further include a substantially straight joining surface that connects the second leading edge to the second bearing surface such that the joining surface is angled radially inward with respect to a tangent of the second bearing surface by a first angle.",
    "8055970": "According to one embodiment of the invention, a computer implemented method for computing a data integrity algorithm on a data stream comprises the acts of initializing a plurality of threads, partitioning the data stream into a plurality of data stream segments, calculating a number of data integrity values from the plurality of data stream segments, and verifying the integrity of the data stream using the data integrity values. The plurality of threads are executed at generally the same time. Each of the data integrity values are derived from an associated data stream segment. The digital transmission of data from one computing system to another has become an important facet of today's distributed computer architectures. To verify the reliability of this data following transit, a number of data integrity algorithms have been developed. These data integrity algorithms serve to ensure that data remains unaltered following transmission from one computing system to another. To accomplish this, a data integrity value may be calculated from the data integrity algorithm at the transmitting computing system and subsequently transmitted to the receiving computing system along with the data. Following receipt of the data, another data integrity value may be calculated and compared with the transmitted data integrity value. In this manner, a relatively high level of reliability of the data may be accomplished as it is transmitted from one computing system to another. According to one embodiment of the invention, a computer implemented method for computing a data integrity algorithm on a data stream comprises the acts of initializing a plurality of threads, partitioning the data stream into a plurality of data stream segments, calculating a number of data integrity values from the plurality of data stream segments, and verifying the integrity of the data stream using the data integrity values.

The plurality of threads are executed at generally the same time. Each of the data integrity values are derived from an associated data stream segment. Some embodiments of the invention provide numerous technical advantages. Some embodiments may benefit from some, none, or all of these advantages. For example, according to one embodiment, the validity of a data stream may be verified using a data integrity algorithm in a relatively shorter period of time as compared to conventional implementations. Conventional implementations of integrity algorithm systems and methods were limited to usage of the computing abilities of only one processor. That is, a multi-processor computing system having additional computing abilities would essentially remain under-utilized, a problem that the teachings of the present invention does not have. According to some embodiments, an increase in throughput is accorded to the manner in which the data integrity algorithms are utilized. By creating multiple threads that act on multiple processors (if available), each thread executes one instance of the specified data integrity algorithm on a subset of the supplied data and computes a data integrity value for the subset that it processes. Such may be contrasted with a conventional usage of data integrity algorithms on multi-processor machines where one processor is heavily utilized while the remaining processors remain essentially idle. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention may provide for the usage of all available processors for the data integrity calculation resulting in throughput increases on multi-processor machines. Other technical advantages may be readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art.",

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the machine is an Intel processor based machine running Windows 98, Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, and the browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or above. The report can use any file system output (e.g., an MFT Fast Scan). The report comprises grids and graphs, and both can be drilled down into supporting detail. In one embodiment, the report is displayed in a spreadsheet-like grid, with optional graphs displayed to summarize information in the grid. The report allows users to manage their files, or portions of their files, directly from the report, relieving system administrators of this burden. Thus, users can, among other actions, open, edit, explore, run, select, clear, find, delete, copy or move files. Active Reports is self-contained and Web-based, and is thus very easy to install and use. A Web server is not required, and the reporting application can be emailed. Alternatively, a user can access a Web site and use the reporting application by clicking on an icon. Once the user clicks on the icon, the program will check to see if the reporting application is installed. If it is not yet installed, it is automatically installed at this time.",

    "9448282": "A system and method are provided for selective bit-wise masking of X-values in scan channels in an integrated circuit (IC) during a built-in self test (BIST). The composite mask pattern is selectively generated according to locations of X-values identified in a simulation of the IC. The composite mask pattern is stored on the IC and cyclically maintained while being applied to the operational scan results of the IC. The composite mask pattern is recycled over a plurality of scan iterations to effectively prevent the X-values from influencing the resulting signature of the BIST that represents a functional fingerprint of the IC and minimize storage requirements for the composite mask pattern.",
    "5983163": "A method for calculating the orientation of a geologic feature with respect to the axis of a wellbore drilled through earth formations. The method uses finely detailed measurements of a selected property of the earth formations made along the wall of the wellbore. The method includes the steps of segregating the finely detailed measurements by an angle subtended with respect to an arbitrary reference on the circumference of the wellbore. The measurements are further segregated into a selected axial interval along the wellbore. For each segment, for each subtended angle, the segregated measurements are spectrally analyzed with respect to spatial frequency. Coefficients of a best fit curve are determined for the phase components of the spectrally analyzed measurements with respect to the subtended angle. The orientation of the geologic feature is calculated from the best fit curve. In the preferred embodiment a noise floor is calculated in each segment by stacking the amplitude components at each spatial frequency in each interval. For each spatial frequency, the stacked amplitude is compared to the noise floor. Only spatial frequencies having amplitudes above the noise floor are used to generate the best fit curve from their respective phase components."
