    "8164980": "A drill string component includes a box-end and a pin-end. Each end includes a signal transceiver, which are operably coupled together. Each signal transceiver communicates with another signal transceiver in another component to form a communication network in the drillstring. An end-cap may be placed in the central bore of the pin-end of a component to form an annular chamber between a side of the end-cap and a wall of the central bore of the pin-end when the end-cap is disposed in the central bore. In some embodiments, an electronics module may be placed in the annular chamber and configured to communicate with one of the signal transceivers. Accelerometer data, as well as other sensor data, at various locations along the drillstring may be sampled by the electronics module and communicated to a remote computer. Drillstring motion dynamics, such as vibration, may be determined based on the accelerometer data.The oil and gas industry expends sizable sums to design cutting tools, such as downhole drill bits including roller cone rock bits and fixed cutter bits, which have relatively long service lives, with relatively infrequent failure. In particular, considerable sums are expended to design and manufacture roller cone rock bits and fixed cutter bits in a manner that minimizes the opportunity for catastrophic drill bit failure during drilling operations. The loss of a roller cone or a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) from a fixed cutter bit during drilling operations can impede the drilling operations and, at worst, necessitate rather expensive fishing operations. If the fishing operations fail, sidetrack-drilling operations must be performed in order to drill around the portion of the wellbore that includes the lost roller cones or PDC cutters. Typically, during drilling operations, bits are pulled and replaced with new bits even though significant service could be obtained from the replaced bit. These premature replacements of downhole drill bits are expensive, since each trip out of the well prolongs the overall drilling activity, and consumes considerable manpower, but are nevertheless done in order to avoid the far more disruptive and expensive process of, at best, pulling the drillstring and replacing the bit or fishing and sidetrack-drilling operations necessary if one or more cones or compacts are lost due to bit failure. In one embodiment of the invention, a drill bit for drilling a subterranean formation comprises a bit body, a shank, a data analysis module, and an end-cap. The bit body carries at least one cutting element (also referred to as a blade or a cutter). The shank is secured to the bit body, is adapted for coupling to a drillstring, and includes a central bore formed therethrough. The data analysis module may be configured in an annular ring such that it may be disposed in the central bore while permitting passage of drilling fluid therethrough. Finally, the end-cap is configured for disposition in the central bore such that the end-cap has the annular ring of the data analysis module disposed therearound and provides a chamber for the data analysis module by providing a sealing structure between the end-cap and the wall of the central bore.",

    "5871260": "A continuous mining machine is provided for mining ultra thin coal seams, e.g. seams having a thickness of about 24 inches or less. A chassis supported by crawler tracks has a substantially horizontal axis powered cutter head mounted to its front and a conveyor extending from a gathering head toward the rear of the chassis. The conveyor includes a conveyor chain driven by at least one motor near the rear of the chassis for driving a sprocket. The gathering head includes a pair of counter-rotating discs with upstanding vanes and a deck having a maximum angle of about 10.degree. with respect to the dimension of elongation of the chassis. A small diameter idler sprocket for the conveyor chain is mounted beneath the deck, and a small diameter drive sprocket is provided for the cutting chain of the cutting head. The mining machine is controlled to keep it within a coal seam to be cut by using a first color video camera scanning the ceiling of the bore cut by the miner, and a second color video camera facing the floor. The mining machine may be used in a method of mining in which, after formation of a main bore of about 300-600 feet long, during withdrawal the machine forms a number of angled bores each roughly as long as the length of the machine. There are literally millions of tons of coal in the United States alone that are found in thin coal seams (having a thickness of about four feet or less), and ultra thin coal seams (having a thickness of around two feet or less). Utilizing conventional equipment and techniques the vast majority of this coal is unrecoverable. While auger miners can be successful in thin and ultra thin seams, augers are very limited in the depth of bore they can form (typically limited to about 150 feet), and because of the circular bores that they form leave a great deal of coal between penetrations. It was for that reason that the continuous mining machine in U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,735 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein) was developed. That mining machine, marketed in commercial form by Lee-Norse under the trade designations CM245 and CM285, is the shortest continuous miner (non-auger) believed to ever have been commercialized. For example the CM245 has a chassis height of only about 24 inches, and can be used in coal seams as thin as 30 inches. While that machine is a significant advance in the art and has great functionality for a number of thin coal seams, its design makes it--as a practical matter--impossible to reduce its size further to allow it to be used in ultra thin coal seams.",

    "4390975": "Data is transmitted through a drill string by means of acoustical energy by transmitting an acoustical signal for a first predetermined interval and ceasing transmission of the signal for a second predetermined interval to represent a first binary state; ceasing transmission of the signal for a third predetermined interval to represent a second binary state; and combining transmission and cessation of transmission of the signal in binary sequences representative of borehole data.The desirability of telemetering information to the surface from a borehole while drilling has long been recognized. The best method presently in use is to cease drilling and lower an electronic instrument package into the borehole by means of a conductor cable to measure temperature, pressure, inclination, direction, etc. Borehole conditions of interest are measured and transmitted electrically up the cable to the surface where they are interpreted and displayed on surface instruments. After use the instrument and cable must be removed from the borehole before recommencing drilling in rotary drilling is used. Use can be left in place until another section of drill pipe must be added to the drill string, however, if a downhole mud motor is used to drive the drill bit. Insertion and removal of such instruments require a considerable amount of time during which drilling cannot occur. It has been estimated that elimination of such costly drilling rig down-time by means of while-drilling telemetry systems could eliminate 5% to 6% of direct production platform drilling costs in offshore platforms. The applicant has disclosed in previous patents, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,148, utilization of an acoustical transmission system in which an acoustical signal is inserted into a drill string at one location at a nominal frequency and is detected at a second location. The signal is then repeated and retransmitted at a second nominal frequency to a second detector, where it is in turn repeated and retransmitted to a third detector located at a third position in the drill string. After the third repeater the sequence of frequencies is repeated in subsequent repeaters until the signal reaches the surface and is detected and read out. It was disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 644,686 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,148 that these nominal frequencies are in fact two frequencies that are separated by only a very small frequency difference (e.g., 20 Hz.). In that application it was disclosed that information is encoded into an intelligible form for acoustical transmission along the drill string into binary coded data according to the frequency-shift-keyed modulation (FSK) system. The information concerning borehole parameters is converted from analog or other form to digitally coded words which are used to modulate the FSK system. The FSK system represents digital data by shifting between the aforementioned two nominal frequencies. One frequency is used to represent a binary zero and the other to represent a binary one, and by shifting between the two frequencies in the proper sequence binary words can be represented. The encoded FSK signals can then be used to drive an electro-acoustical transducer, or other suitable device, which induces the desired signals into the drill string in the form of acoustical signals. Referring to FIG. 1 a diagram illustrating the transmission characteristics of a drill pipe is shown. Signal 100 is a typical FSK modulated signal having a portion 102 at a frequency F.sub.1 representing a digital one and a portion 104 at a frequency F.sub.2 representing a digital zero. Signal 106 represents a DC analog of signal 100 and has a pulse portion 108 representing the digital one and a zero level portion 110 representing the digital zero. Signal 106 is shown in two different states. State 112 shows the signal response in a nonresonant condition in the drill pipe. The signal has a relatively low level and is accompanied by a following edge 114 having a sharp drop off. Signal 116 represents the same signal in a resonant condition in a drill pipe. This signal has a relatively higher amplitude, but in this case is accompanied by a slowly decaying following edge 118. It is well known that an excitation in a resonant system will resonate while the system is being excited and will continue to resonate, although decreasing with time, long after the excitation has ceased to be applied. Following edge 118, therefore, represents the decaying portion of signal 106 in a resonant drill pipe condition. It can readily be seen that in portion 110 the signal representing the digital one is still present when in fact it is desired that the signal level be at zero in order to represent a digital zero.",

A data fabric is a communication network that interconnects a plurality of distributed computation nodes of a computer system. The distributed computing nodes may be performing a plurality of processes and the data fabric enables the nodes to exchange data and use the data in the performance of the process(es) executing on the local node. The data fabric provides a data infrastructure that distributes and replicates data enabling data to be stored in a distributed memory so that the data may utilized at high rates with low latency and to be frequently updated by a plurality of processes being executed by one or more of the distributed computing nodes of the system.

A cache provides temporary storage for data obtained from a data source enabling subsequent local use of the data without the necessity of repeatedly downloading the data from the data source. For example, a data cache may be used to temporarily store, at a local computer, data that is downloaded from an Internet web site. Latency in the use of the data is substantially reduced by the using the data in the local cache rather than downloading the data from a remote source for each use. The replication of data also provides redundant data storage for the system. If a process holding a replica of data fails, the data can be made available from other replicas held by other processes of the system. The GemFire Enterprise data fabric provides data management enabling creation of a plurality of local data caches consistent with the other data sources of the system and the updating of a plurality of replicas of the data to reflect the changes resulting from the use of the data by the nodes of a distributed system.

    "8990145": "A first data mining model and a second data mining model are compared. A first data mining model M1 represents results of a first data mining task on a first data set D1 and provides a set of first prediction values. A second data mining model M2 represents results of a second data mining task on a second data set D2 and provides a set of second prediction values. A relation R is determined between said sets of prediction values. For at least a first record of an input data set, a first and second probability distribution is created based on the first and second data mining models applied to the first record. A distance measure d is calculated for said first record using the first and second probability distributions and the relation. At least one region of interest is determined based on said distance measure d. The invention provides a method for running a data mining model comparison engine for comparing a first data mining model with a second data mining model. The method comprises the following steps: providing a first data mining model representing results of a first data mining task on a first data set, said first data mining model providing a set of first prediction values; providing a second data mining model representing results of a second data mining task on a second data set, said second data mining model providing a set of second prediction values; providing a relation between said set of first prediction values and said set of second prediction values; determining an input data set; carrying out the following steps on at least a first record of the determined input data set: creating a first probability distribution based on the first data mining model applied to the first record, said first probability distribution associating probabilities with said set of first prediction values; creating a second probability distribution based on the second data mining model applied to the first record, said second probability distribution associating probabilities with said set of second prediction values; calculating a distance measure for said first record using the first and second probability distributions and the relation; determining at least one region of interest based on the distance measure calculated for records of the determined input data set.",
    "8280899": "An event is described herein as being representable by a quantified abstraction of the event. The event includes at least one predicate, and the at least one predicate has at least one constant symbol corresponding thereto. An instance of the constant symbol corresponding to the event is identified, and the instance of the constant symbol is replaced by a free variable to obtain an abstracted predicate. Thus, a quantified abstraction of the event is composed as a pair: the abstracted predicate and a mapping between the free variable and an instance of the constant symbol that corresponds to the predicate. A data mining algorithm is executed over abstracted, quantified events to ascertain a correlation between the event and another event. One of the major themes in data mining is the extraction of patterns existent in a data set. For example, data mining algorithms have been commissioned to recognize correlations in purchase patterns of consumers. For instance, a data mining algorithm can be employed to ascertain that an individual will generally purchase toothpaste if the individual also purchased a toothbrush. In another example, a data mining algorithm can be commissioned to infer sequential patterns in data. If an individual purchases a shirt, for instance, the data mining algorithm can infer that the individual will likely purchase trousers after purchasing the shirt. Such correlations in transactions can be useful in connection with product placement, marketing, etc.",
    "8775073": "Disclosed is a feature for a vehicle that enables taking precautionary actions in response to conditions on the road network around or ahead of the vehicle, in particular, an intersection without traffic signals and without a sufficient merge lane. A database that represents the road network is used to determine locations where roads meet without a traffic signal and without a sufficient merge lane. Then, precautionary action data is added to the database to indicate a location at which a precautionary action is to be taken about the location of the insufficient merge lane. A precautionary action system installed in a vehicle uses this database, or a database derived therefrom, in combination with a positioning system to determine when the vehicle is at a location that corresponds to the location of a precautionary action. When the vehicle is at such a location, a precautionary action is taken by a vehicle system as the vehicle is approaching a location of an insufficient merge lane. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including active safety and fuel economy systems, have been developed to improve the comfort, efficiency, safety, and overall satisfaction of driving. Examples of these advanced driver assistance systems include adaptive headlight aiming, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and control, curve warning, speed limit notification, hazard warning, predictive cruise control, and adaptive shift control, as well as others. Some of these advanced driver assistance systems use a variety of sensor mechanisms in the vehicle to determine the current state of the vehicle and the current state of the roadway in front of the vehicle. These sensor mechanisms may include radar, infrared, ultrasonic and vision-oriented sensors, such as digital video cameras and lidar. Some advanced driver assistance systems also use digital map data. Digital map data can be used in advanced driver assistance systems to provide information about the road network, road geometry, road conditions and other items associated with the road and terrain around the vehicle. Digital map data is not affected by environmental conditions, such as fog, rain or snow. In addition, digital map data can provide useful information that cannot reliably be provided by cameras or radar, such as curvature, grade, bank, speed limits that are not indicated by signage, traffic and lane restrictions, etc. Further, digital map data can provide a predictive capability well beyond the range of other sensors or even beyond the driver's vision to determine the road ahead of the vehicle, around corners, over hills or beyond obstructions. Accordingly, digital map data can be a useful addition for some advanced driver assistance systems.",
    "9256837": "Roughly described, a computer-implemented evolutionary data mining system includes a memory storing a candidate gene database containing active and shadow individuals; a gene pool processor which tests only active individuals on training data and updates their fitness estimates; a competition module which selects individuals (both active and shadow) for discarding from the gene pool in dependence upon both their updated fitness estimate and their testing experience level; and a gene harvesting module providing for deployment selected ones of the individuals from the gene pool. The gene database has an experience layered elitist pool, and individuals to compete only with other individuals in their same layer. Shadow individuals are created in each layer for active individuals that survive all competition with the layer before their testing experience exceeds the testing experience range for the layer. Applicants have recognized, however, that in some circumstances it is possible for a relatively less fit individual to enter the elitist pool and soon graduate to the next higher layer, only because the more fit individuals in the destination layer are themselves graduating out of that layer. In this way it is possible for a relatively less fit individual to remain in the candidate gene database and work its way all the way up to the top layer, at which point it is finally discarded. It can be a waste of scarce resources to continue testing individuals that will eventually be eliminated. In order to address this type of situation, roughly described, a system can be arranged to remember, in conjunction with each testing experience layer, the fitness estimates of the individuals that have survived the competitions in a particular layer for long enough that their testing experience level has now qualified them for a higher layer. These so-called shadow individuals remain involved in the fitness competitions among individuals in or entering the particular layer, until they themselves are eliminated by the competition. However, they no longer receive testing in the particular layer.",
    "4968098": "A continuous mining apparatus such as a coal milling or shearing machine includes sensors mounted on the machine frame or on the cutter bits, including an accelerometer and one or more strain gauges, for sensing vibrations and stresses exerted on the cutter bits during operation of the machine. A signal conditioning and amplification circuit provides an audio and/or visual display indicating when the cutter is moving outside of the coal seam and/or is cutting along a cleat or other joint to improve excavation rates while maintaining or lowering stress levels on the cutter bits. The display enables the machine operator to keep from penetrating the roof or floor of the coal seam and to position the cutter to take advantage of natural fracture lines in the seam. The frequency spectrum of the sensor signals is determined to distinguish vibrations caused by bit interaction with the material being cut. The present invention provides a system and method for detecting a change in milling or similar cutting operations for the mining of coal and similar minerals. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system associated with a coal milling or shearing machine which detects strains and vibrations of the machine cutting elements to provide a signal indicating a change in the cutting forces exerted on the coal seam to minimize the excursion of the cutting machine out of the coal seam. The system of the present invention is also operable to detect the relative resistance to the cutting effort whereby the cutting operation may be conducted along faults or discontinuities in the seam such as are formed by cleats or slips to improve the rate of excavation of the coal and minimize the stresses imposed on the cutting equipment.",
    "9529550": "Techniques are described for managing access of executing programs to non-local block data storage. In some situations, a block data storage service uses multiple server storage systems to reliably store network-accessible block data storage volumes that may be used by programs executing on other physical computing systems. A group of multiple server block data storage systems that store block data volumes may in some situations be co-located at a data center, and programs that use volumes stored there may execute on other physical computing systems at that data center. If a program using a volume becomes unavailable, another program (e.g., another copy of the same program) may in some situations obtain access to and continue to use the same volume, such as in an automatic manner in some such situations. Techniques are described for managing access of executing programs to non-local block data storage. In at least some embodiments, the techniques include providing a block data storage service that uses multiple server storage systems to reliably store block data that may be accessed and used over one or more networks by programs executing on other physical computing systems. Users of the block data storage service may each create one or more block data storage volumes that each have a specified amount of block data storage space, and may initiate use of such a block data storage volume (also referred to as a volume herein) by one or more executing programs, with at least some such volumes having copies stored by two or more of the multiple server storage systems so as to enhance volume reliability and availability to the executing programs. As one example, the multiple server block data storage systems that store block data may in some embodiments be organized into one or more pools or other groups that each have multiple physical server storage systems co-located at a geographical location, such as in each of one or more geographically distributed data centers, and the program(s) that use a volume stored on a server block data storage system in a data center may execute on one or more other physical computing systems at that data center.

    "9367590": "A method and procedure for large-scaled Internet data mining and data analytics for consumers over the cloud. The method describes an online market place which include an authoring tool generating computer scripts, executing the script to acquire data from URL, wherein the sequence of script instructions performs extraction and transformation of data, aggregating it into a dataset, publishing it for data consumer to pair with data analytics software programs in analyzing the dataset. The current invention introduces a novel method and procedure to offer a simple approach to this complicated problem. A cloud-based market place is created to provide service to three groups of participants using three interactive components, namely, the data producer, the data consumer, and the data analytics software provider. A data producer platform is a cloud-based platform for those who are familiar with the domain knowledge to aggregate data. It offers a simple script language for novice to mine domain specific data from the Internet. The script represents a single instance of the data being collected in a discrete time moment. The platform offers an automated method for a data producer to activate the script and define the time interval for data to be acquired. Each instance of the data is a row in a data table. Data acquired over time are aggregated as time-based rows to form a dataset, and is stored in a storage system such as network attached storage (NAS), local file store, or distributive system like HADOOP, where it will be ready for use by analytic software as input source for data analytics processing. The entire process forms a business model where data producers can use the system to harvest data from the Internet, and data analytic software providers can offer analytic algorithms as ready-made and ready-use software on known datasets as an offer in a marketplace, and make the result of the data analysis available for third parties, namely, data consumer. The social network aspect offers by this market place--collaboration among data producer, data analytics software provider, and data consumer--does not exist today. This invention will result in the creation of a new kind of social network that focuses on connecting the three roles of participants for one common purpose of providing data awareness and data analytics, bringing data analytics to consumers."
